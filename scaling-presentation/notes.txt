       scaling of problems:

discussion:
-computer is incredibly powerful as an abacus replacement
-A computer's computations appear to be 'free' to a user because it requires none of the blood, sweat, or tears of a human's computations. 
-However, there some nonzero amount of time required for each computation as well as some nonzero amount of storage for, e.g. for intermediate computations 
-the time/storage requirements of a program increase with its input size 
-study of time/storage requirements of programs is termed analysis of algorithms
